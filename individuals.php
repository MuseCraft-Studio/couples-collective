                        <p>We work with individuals to support each person's growth and life goals. In individual therapy, we use the EFT model to work together to build a better understanding of relationship and personal habitual patterns that no longer serve you and your aspirations to having relationships that you want.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: var(--font-work-sans-bold)">Is therapy working for you?</p>
                        <p>
                            One of the highest indicators for success in therapy is the rapport and relationship with your therapist. To determine if we would be a good fit, our relationship would start with a no-cost 20 minute phone consultation to determine if my style and areas of focus are aligned with what you are looking to address in your life.

                        Clients are expected to pay for each session at the time it is held or, if you prefer, you may pay in advance. Please contact us to discuss fees as they vary based on each therapist.

                        We recommend an initial couples counseling session of 80 minutes. Subsequent sessions typically run 55 - 60 mins for couples, but can be adjusted to 80 upon request.
