                    <div class="small-title">Emotional Safety</div>
                    <div>
                        EFT prioritizes creating a safe emotional space for couples to explore their feelings and vulnerabilities. This emotional safety is crucial for addressing issues related to sex and intimacy, as it allows individuals to express their fears, desires, and concerns without judgment or criticism.

                    <div class="small-title">Understanding Attachment</div>
                    <div>
                        EFT therapists recognize that our early attachment experiences often shape our ability to connect with others, including in intimate settings. By exploring attachment patterns, EFT helps couples understand the underlying causes of their sexual and intimacy issues.

                    <div>
                        Effective communication is at the heart of resolving sexual and intimacy issues. EFT equips couples with the tools to express their needs, desires, and boundaries clearly, fostering better understanding and connection.

                    <div>
                        Many couples struggle with negative cycles of interaction that contribute to sexual and intimacy problems. EFT helps identify these patterns and replace them with healthier, more constructive ways of relating to each other.

                    <div>
                        EFT can help rebuild trust, which is often eroded by sexual or intimacy issues. Trust is essential for feeling safe and vulnerable in an intimate relationship.

                            When partners have different levels of desire, EFT helps them understand each other's needs and work together to find a satisfying compromise.

                            EFT provides a safe environment to discuss and address performance-related concerns, reducing anxiety and increasing sexual confidence.

                            For couples feeling emotionally distant, EFT can help them rediscover emotional intimacy, which often leads to improved physical intimacy.
