                        Providing expert EFT relationship counseling for individuals

                        <p>We work with individuals to support each person's growth and life goals. In individual therapy, we use the EFT model to work together to build a better understanding of relationship and personal habitual patterns that no longer serve you and your aspirations to having relationships that you want.</p>
                        <p style="font-family: var(--font-work-sans-bold)">Is therapy working for you?</p>
                        <p>
                            One of the highest indicators for success in therapy is the rapport and relationship with your therapist. To determine if we would be a good fit, our relationship would start with a no-cost 20 minute phone consultation to determine if my style and areas of focus are aligned with what you are looking to address in your life.

                        <p>Do you feel lonely, unacknowledged, or stuck in your partnership? When you try to communicate, does it seem like you’re talking to a wall—as if your feelings don't really matter? Do you ever think you are not good enough—that you can never catch a break or get it right?</p>
                        <p>Perhaps you lack depth in your relationship and want to break down emotional barriers and enhance your physical connection. Conversely, maybe an act of infidelity has fractured your trust, and you want to know if there is still any hope for your marriage. As a relationship evolves, it's natural for couples to run into unexpected challenges. For instance, you may be having trouble coordinating your communication or parenting styles in a blended family dynamic. Or your partner may have put up emotional barriers, and you don't know how to make a connection without feeling criticized or misunderstood for trying. And if you are recovering from infidelity, it can be extremely difficult managing the intense mix of emotions in a way that promotes internal healing.</p>
